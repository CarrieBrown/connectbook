[title]: - "Annual, Week-Long OSG User School"

## Overview

During this week-long training event held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison every summer, students learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at their own campus or using the Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and lots of hands-on activities with experienced OSG staff, students will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets, to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help.

The School is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff. Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School.
